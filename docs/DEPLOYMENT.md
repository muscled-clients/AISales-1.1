## üöÄ Quick Deployment (Recommended)

### Step 1: Build Distribution Packages

**For Windows Team Members:**
```bash
# Run the automated build script
scripts\build-for-team.bat

# Or manually:
npm install
npm run build
npm run dist:win
```

**For macOS Team Members:**
```bash

npm run dist:mac
```

**For Cross-Platform Teams:**
```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run dist:all  # Builds for Windows, macOS, and Linux
```

### Step 2: Distribute Files

The build process creates these files in the `dist/` folder:

**Windows:**
- `SmartCallMate-Setup-1.0.0.exe` - Full installer (recommended)

## üè¢ Enterprise Deployment

### For Large Teams (10+ Users)

#### Centralized Configuration
1. **Pre-configure API Keys:**
   ```bash
   # Create settings template
   mkdir -p templates
   echo '{
     "deepgramApiKey": "YOUR_COMPANY_KEY",
     "openaiApiKey": "YOUR_COMPANY_KEY",
     "autoSuggestions": true,
     "autoTodos": true
   }' > templates/settings.json
   ```

2. **Deploy with Group Policy (Windows):**
   - Create MSI installer with pre-configured settings
   - Deploy via Active Directory Group Policy
   - Set registry keys for API configuration

3. **Deploy with MDM (macOS):**
   - Use Jamf, Workspace ONE, or similar
   - Create configuration profile
   - Push app and settings to managed devices

#### Network Installation Script
```batch
@echo off
echo Installing SmartCallMate for all users...
\\fileserver\software\SmartCallMate-Setup-1.0.0.exe /S
copy "\\fileserver\config\smartcallmate-settings.json" "%APPDATA%\ai-sales-assistant\"
echo Installation complete!
```

### Security Considerations
- **API Key Management:** Consider using environment variables
- **Network Policy:** Ensure access to deepgram.com and api.openai.com
- **User Permissions:** App needs microphone access
- **Firewall Rules:** Allow WebSocket connections for transcription

## üí∞ Cost Planning for Teams

### API Usage Estimates (per person/month)

**Deepgram Transcription:**
- Light usage (1 hour/day): ~20 hours = $8
- Heavy usage (4 hours/day): ~80 hours = $32
- Free tier: 45,000 minutes total

**OpenAI Chat:**
- Light usage: ~50,000 tokens = $0.10
- Heavy usage: ~200,000 tokens = $0.40

**Total Monthly Cost per User:** $8-35 (depending on usage)

### Team Pricing Models

#### Option 1: Individual API Keys

- Individual billing and usage tracking
- Good for small teams (2-5 people)

#### Option 2: Shared Company Keys
- Single set of API keys for entire team
- Centralized billing and management
- Better for larger teams (5+ people)
- Requires enterprise-level API accounts

1. Build new version: `npm run dist`
2. Distribute new installer files
3. Team members install over existing version
4. Settings and data preserved

#### Automatic Updates (Advanced)
1. Set up update server
2. Configure electron-updater in app
3. Enable automatic update checks
4. Users get notified of new versions

### Version Control for Teams
```bash
# Tag releases
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0

# Create release builds
npm run dist
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting for Team Deployment

### Common Distribution Issues

#### "App won't start" (Windows)
- **Solution**: Install Visual C++ Redistributable
- **Prevention**: Include runtime in installer

#### "Developer cannot be verified" (macOS)
- **Solution**: Right-click ‚Üí Open ‚Üí Open
- **Prevention**: Code sign the app (requires Apple Developer account)

#### "Missing dependencies"
- **Solution**: Ensure complete dist package
- **Prevention**: Test installer on clean machine

### Support Strategy for Teams

1. **Create Internal Documentation**
   - Customize SETUP.md with company-specific info
   - Add internal support contacts
   - Include company API key procedures

2. **Designate App Champions**
   - Train 1-2 team members as super users
   - They handle first-line support
   - Escalate technical issues to developer

3. **Set Up Feedback Channel**
   - Slack channel or Teams group
   - Email alias for bug reports
   - Regular feedback sessions
