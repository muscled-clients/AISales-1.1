## Querying Data

### View recent sessions with conversation counts
```sql
SELECT
  s.*,
  COUNT(c.id) as conversation_count
FROM recording_sessions s
LEFT JOIN ai_conversations c ON c.session_id = s.id
GROUP BY s.id
ORDER BY s.started_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### View conversations for a session
```sql
SELECT * FROM ai_conversations
WHERE session_id = 'your-session-id'
ORDER BY created_at ASC;
```

## Environment Variables
