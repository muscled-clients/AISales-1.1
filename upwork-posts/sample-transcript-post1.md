# Sample Sales Call Transcript - GenAI Platform Project

## Opening & Introduction (0:00 - 2:30)

**You**: "Hi Sarah, great to connect! I saw your post about the GenAI platform you're building for your enterprise client. Sounds like an exciting project that's already showing promise in MVP stage."

**Client (Sarah)**: "Yes, hi! Thanks for reaching out. We've been working on this for about three months now and we've got something functional, but we're hitting some walls as we try to scale."

**You**: "I noticed you mentioned you're dealing with RAG optimization issues and hitting OpenAI rate limits. Before we dive into the technical challenges, can you tell me a bit about what this platform does for your enterprise client?"

**Client**: "Sure, so we're building an AI-powered knowledge assistant for one of the largest insurance companies in the country. They have decades of documentation, policies, claims data, and they want their agents to be able to query all of this instantly. Right now we have about 50 beta users, but they want to roll this out to 5,000 agents by Q2 next year."

**You**: "That's a significant scale jump. And with insurance data, I imagine accuracy is critical?"

**Client**: "Exactly. That's why the RAG retrieval issues are killing us. Sometimes it pulls completely irrelevant policy sections when an agent asks about specific coverage details."

## Technical Deep Dive (2:30 - 8:00)

**You**: "Let's talk about your current RAG setup. You mentioned you're using Pinecone - how are you chunking your documents currently?"

**Client**: "We're doing 512 token chunks with 50 token overlaps. We tried smaller chunks but then we lose context, and bigger chunks seem to make relevance worse."

**You**: "Are you using any metadata filtering or hybrid search approaches?"

**Client**: "We have basic metadata like document type and date, but honestly, we haven't really optimized the metadata strategy. What do you mean by hybrid search?"

**You**: "So beyond just vector similarity, you can combine that with keyword search, BM25 scoring, or even knowledge graphs. I worked on a similar project for a legal firm where we improved retrieval accuracy by 40% by implementing a hybrid approach with metadata filtering based on practice areas and case precedence."

**Client**: "That sounds exactly like what we need. Our insurance policies have similar hierarchical structures - different coverage types, state regulations, policy versions."

**You**: "Right, and for your chunking strategy, have you considered using semantic chunking instead of fixed-size chunks? For structured documents like insurance policies, you want chunks that respect section boundaries."

**Client**: "We haven't tried that. To be honest, our team is strong on general backend development, but this specialized AI optimization is where we're struggling."

## Rate Limiting & Scaling Discussion (8:00 - 12:00)

**You**: "Now about those 429 errors - tell me about your current API call patterns. Are you hitting rate limits during normal operations or just during peak usage?"

**Client**: "It's frustrating. Even with just 50 users, if more than 10 people use it simultaneously, we start hitting TPM limits. We're on OpenAI's tier 3, so we have 1 million TPM, but complex insurance queries can easily be 8-10k tokens per request."

**You**: "Are you implementing any caching strategies currently?"

**Client**: "Basic response caching, but insurance agents often ask very specific, unique questions, so cache hit rate is pretty low, maybe 15%."

**You**: "I see several opportunities here. First, semantic caching - instead of exact match caching, you can cache responses for semantically similar queries. Second, request queuing with priority levels. Third, have you considered using multiple API keys or even multiple providers?"

**Client**: "Multiple providers? Wouldn't that affect consistency?"

**You**: "Not if you implement it correctly. I recently helped a fintech company set up a multi-provider strategy - OpenAI for complex reasoning, Claude for document analysis, and Mistral for simple queries. We reduced costs by 60% and eliminated rate limit issues entirely. Plus, we implemented automatic fallbacks."

**Client**: "That's interesting. Our CFO would love the cost reduction aspect. The enterprise client is already concerned about the per-query costs scaling to 5,000 users."

## Architecture & Performance (12:00 - 16:00)

**You**: "Looking at your stack - Python, FastAPI, Pinecone, Postgres on Supabase - that's solid. But for enterprise scale, have you thought about implementing a message queue system?"

**Client**: "We discussed it but haven't implemented anything yet. Would that help with the rate limiting?"

**You**: "Absolutely. With something like Redis or RabbitMQ, you can queue requests, implement priority levels for different user tiers, batch similar queries, and smooth out traffic spikes. I implemented this for an e-commerce AI assistant that went from handling 100 concurrent users to 10,000."

**Client**: "10,000? That's exactly the scale we need to hit eventually. What about the response times? Insurance agents won't wait 30 seconds for an answer."

**You**: "That's where the architecture becomes critical. You'd want to implement streaming responses, parallel retrieval strategies, and potentially even predictive pre-fetching for common query patterns. What's your current average response time?"

**Client**: "About 8-12 seconds for complex queries, 3-5 seconds for simple ones."

**You**: "We can definitely improve that. With proper optimization, even complex RAG queries should complete in under 5 seconds. I achieved 2-3 second response times for a similar system handling medical documentation, which is just as complex as insurance docs."

## Web Search & Advanced Features (16:00 - 20:00)

**Client**: "You mentioned you've built custom web search integrations. Right now we're just using ChatGPT's built-in web search, but it's a black box and sometimes returns outdated information."

**You**: "For insurance, where regulations change frequently, you definitely want more control. I'd recommend implementing a custom solution using something like Serper API or Brave Search API, combined with your own relevance filtering and date prioritization."

**Client**: "Would that integrate with our existing RAG pipeline?"

**You**: "Absolutely. Think of it as another retrieval source. You can even implement a routing layer that decides whether to search internal documents, web, or both based on the query type. For instance, questions about current regulations would trigger web search, while policy-specific questions stay internal."

**Client**: "That makes sense. We're also thinking about adding conversational memory. Agents often have follow-up questions about the same claim or policy."

**You**: "Conversation management is crucial for enterprise AI. You'll want both short-term memory for the current session and long-term memory for returning users. I typically implement this with a combination of Redis for session state and Postgres for conversation history, with smart summarization to keep context windows manageable."

## Closing & Next Steps (20:00 - 25:00)

**Client**: "This all sounds great. To be honest, you clearly have the expertise we need. What would your approach be if we brought you on?"

**You**: "I'd suggest starting with a two-week assessment and optimization sprint. Week one: deep dive into your current implementation, benchmark performance, identify bottlenecks. Week two: implement quick wins - caching improvements, request queuing, and basic RAG optimizations. Then we'd have a clear roadmap for the full enterprise-grade transformation."

**Client**: "What about availability? This is pretty urgent for us."

**You**: "I can start immediately and dedicate 30 hours per week initially. Based on what you've described, I estimate 4-6 weeks to resolve your critical issues, then ongoing optimization as you scale."

**Client**: "And your rate?"

**You**: "For this level of specialized GenAI optimization, my rate is $55 per hour. Given the complexity and the value to your enterprise client, I believe that's very reasonable. I've saved companies hundreds of thousands in API costs alone through optimization."

**Client**: "That's within our budget. One last question - have you worked with enterprise compliance requirements before? Insurance is heavily regulated."

**You**: "Yes, I've implemented AI systems for healthcare and financial services, both heavily regulated industries. I'm familiar with data governance, audit trails, and ensuring AI explanability for compliance purposes. We can build in proper logging and monitoring from the start."

**Client**: "Excellent. I need to discuss with my team, but I think you're exactly what we're looking for. Can you send me a brief proposal outlining what we discussed?"

**You**: "Absolutely. I'll include the initial assessment plan, proposed optimizations, and some case studies from similar projects. You'll have it within the hour."

**Client**: "Perfect. Looking forward to it. This could really accelerate our timeline."

**You**: "Happy to help. This is exactly the type of challenge I enjoy solving. Talk soon!"
